Notes on this Owner's Handbook
We have tried to make all the informa-
tion in this Owner's Handbook easy to
find. The quickest access to a particular
topic or item is by consulting the
detailed alphabetical index at the end.
Consult the first chapter for an initial
overview of your car. The detailed list of
contents on the preceding pages is
intended to arouse your curiosity about
your new BMW and encourage you to
read this information carefully.
When the time comes to sell your
BMW, please remember to hand over
this Owner's Handbook; it is regarded
legally as part of the vehicle.
If you have any queries, BMW Service
will be glad to advise you.

followed precisely in order to
avoid the possibility of personal injury
and serious damage to the vehicle.<

However, certain systems can only
be activated or adjusted by BMW
Service.<
Your car
When you ordered your BMW, you
chose various items of equipment. This
handbook describes all models and
equipment specifications which BMW
offers within this particular model line.
This explains why the handbook may
also contain details of items which you
have not ordered. The differences can
easily be identified by the asterisk *
shown against optional extras.
If your BMW contains equipment that
is not described in this Owner's Hand-
book (e.g. a car radio or telephone),
supplementary operating instructions
will be supplied and you are requested
to study and comply with them.

The high safety and quality standards
of BMW vehicles are maintained by
unceasing development work on
designs, equipment and accessories.
Because of this, your car may differ
from the information supplied in the
Owner's Handbook. Nor can errors and
omissions be entirely ruled out. You are
therefore asked to appreciate that no
legal claims can be entertained on the
basis of the data, illustrations or
descriptions in this handbook.
In cars with right-hand drive,
some controls will be located
differently from those illustrated in this
handbook.<
For your own safety
Use only parts and accessory
products which BMW has
approved for your car.
Parts and products which BMW has
approved for your car have been
checked for safety, function and suita-
bility. BMW accepts product liability for
them.
BMW cannot accept liability for parts or
accessory products of any kind which it
has not approved.
BMW is unable to assess each indivi-
dual product of outside origin as to its
suitability for use on BMW vehicles
without safety risk. Nor can suitability
be assured if a specific national permit
(e. g. General Operating Permit) has
been issued or if, for example, an offi-
cial inspection authority (such as the
German TÃœV) has approved the
product. These tests cannot always
take into account the full range of
operating conditions applicable to
BMW vehicles and may therefore be
inadequate.
In short, the functional efficiency or
road safety of your BMW, and also its
value, may be affected if its specifica-
tion is altered by installing parts not
approved for it. Original BMW parts and
accessories, other BMW-approved
products and competent advice on all
related matters are obtainable from
BMW Service.<

Technical equipment that
monitors itself
The functioning of indicator and
warning lights marked "G" is checked
when the ignition is switched on. They
come on once for varying periods.
If a fault occurs in one of the systems,
the corresponding light will remain on
when the engine is started or will come
on again during the journey. The correct
response to this on your part is

If light comes on during journey:
the engine oil is at its absolute
minimum permitted level. Top up
engine oil as soon as possible. Do not
drive more than approx. 50 km
(approx. 30 miles) before adding oil.
Further details: page 150.

Use unleaded fuel
The engine requires exclusively
unleaded fuel, which may be of the
ultra-low sulphur type. Since the
engines have a knock control function,
they can run on different grades of fuel.
Your BMW's engine is rated to run on:
> Super Plus/premium plus fuel
(octane number 98, Research
Method).
Fill up with petrol of this grade when-
ever possible, so that the nominal
performance and fuel consumption
values are achieved.
You can also run the engine on:
> Premium-grade unleaded fuel
(octane number 95, Research
Method).
This fuel is also known as:
DIN EN 228 or Euro-Super.
The minimum permissible grade is:
> Regular-grade unleaded fuel
(octane number 91 RON).
Never use fuel containing lead,
as the oxygen sensor and the
converter will otherwise be permanently
damaged.<
National-market versions
supplied to run on leaded fuel*
In addition to the grades listed on the
left, you can run the engine on leaded
fuel. The minimum grade is likewise
91 RON.
Diesel engines
> Diesel oil to DIN EN 590 standard.
Do not use rapeseed oil methyl
ester (RME) or Biodiesel, or you
risk damaging the engine.<
Winter-grade diesel
To ensure that the diesel engine oper-
ates reliably during the cold season of
the year, it must be run on winter-grade
diesel oil, which garages usually sell
during the period in question. Fuel filter
heating is installed as standard equip-
ment to prevent the fuel from solidifying
during operation.
No additives may be used, as
these could cause damage to the
engine.<

The tyre pressures are also displayed
on the driver's door post (visible with
the driver's door open).
Checking tyre pressures
All tyre pressures in the tables on the
following pages are shown in the most
common units of measurement bar
(kPa/psi) for tyres at ambient tempera-
ture.
When towing a trailer, always use the
values for the higher load.
Cars with Tyre Pressure Control
(RDC)*:
After correcting tyre pressures, reacti-
vate the system; see page 105.
390de697
Check tyre pressures regularly (at
least every two weeks and before
starting a long journey). Incorrect tyre
pressures can adversely affect the car's
roadholding and cause tyre damage,
which could result in an accident.
Remember to check the spare wheel
tyre pressure as well. The highest pres-
sure needed for any of your car's tyres
should be used as the pressure for the
spare wheel.<
Make sure that only approved
tyres are fitted
These tyre pressures apply to sizes and
makes of tyre approved by BMW and
known to BMW Service. If other makes
of tyre are fitted to the car, higher tyre
pressures may be needed.

The set of keys
1 Master key with remote control:
For choice of Key Memory functions,
see page 64
In conjunction with this, you can
identify the keys with the coloured
stickers supplied with the car
Each master key contains a long-
life battery that is automatically
recharged while the car is being driven.
For this reason, you should drive the
car at least once a year for a significant
distance using any master keys that
have not been in regular use, so that
their batteries can be recharged. See
also page 35.<
463de023
2 Spare key, to be kept in a safe place,
for instance in a purse or wallet. This
key is not intended for regular use
3 Key for doors and ignition
This key does not open the luggage
compartment lid/tailgate or the glove
box Â– this can be useful for instance
at a hotel or restaurant with car
parking service
The principle
The central locking system cannot take
effect until both front doors are closed.
The following are unlocked and locked
in combination:
> Doors
> Luggage compartment lid/tailgate
and rear window*
> Tank flap.
The central locking system can be
operated
> From outside the car at the door lock
or with the remote control
> From inside using a button.
When operated from the outside, the
deadlocks are engaged at the same
time. This prevents the doors from
being unlocked either at the safety lock
buttons or door handles. The alarm
system* is also activated or deacti-
vated.
In the event of a collision, the central
locking system is released automati-
cally, but only at doors which were not
locked separately by means of the
inside buttons; see page 37. The
hazard warning flashers and interior
light are also switched on.

The principle
The remote control is an extremely
convenient way to lock and unlock your
car. It also has two additional functions
that can only be operated from the
remote control:
> Switching on the interior lighting, see
page 36
This function enables you to locate
the car, for instance in an under-
ground garage.
> Opening the luggage compartment
lid or tailgate, see page 36
Opens slightly regardless of whether
the lid was previously locked or
unlocked.
When the car is unlocked/locked, the
deadlocks are also deactivated/acti-
vated, the alarm system* switched off/
on, and the interior light switched on/
off.

Master key with remote control
Persons remaining in the car or
pets left inside can lock the doors
from the inside. Always take the car
keys with you so that the car can be
opened from the outside.<
Master keys in regular use are
always operational because when
they are in the ignition switch the
battery they contain is automatically
recharged while the car is being driven.
If the car cannot be locked with the
remote control, the battery in the key is
flat. Use this key for a fairly long journey
so that its battery is recharged. See
also page 32.
To prevent unauthorised persons from
gaining access to the remote control
keys, hand over only door and ignition
key 3 or spare key 2 (see page 32) to
staff at a hotel or in a similar situation.
In the event of faults, contact BMW
Service. Replacement keys are also
available from BMW Service.<
Unlocking
Press the button:
On certain national-market
versions, press the button twice,
the first time to unlock the driver's door,
the second time to release the
remaining locks.<
If you wish, you can have this
special arrangement programmed
for each specific remote control.<
Convenient opening
Hold the button pressed. The windows
and sliding/tilt sunroof open.
Locking and deadlocking
Press the button:
Do not lock the car when there is
someone inside it, as it cannot
then be unlocked from the inside.<
Convenient closure:
Hold the button pressed. The windows
and sliding/tilt sunroof will close.
Watch the closing movement to
ensure that no-one is trapped.
The closing procedure is interrupted if
the button is released.<
You can have a specific signal
selected to confirm that the car
has been locked properly.<
On cars with an alarm system (see
page 44): if the convenient closure
movement is interrupted, the car must
be unlocked again before convenient
closure is undertaken again. Failing
this, the tilt alarm sensor and interior
movement detector will be out of
action.<

Opening the luggage
compartment lid:
Press the button:
The luggage compartment lid opens
slightly regardless of whether the lid
was previously locked or unlocked.
Before and after every journey,
make sure that the luggage
compartment lid has not been opened
accidentally.<
Automatic tailgate operation* Â–
touring
Opening the tailgate lid:
Press the button:
The tailgate lid opens completely,
regardless of whether it was locked or
unlocked.
If the button is pressed while the lid is
opening, the opening process is inter-
rupted.
The tailgate lid swings rearwards
and upwards when opened. The
upper edge of the tailgate is more than
two metres from the ground when fully
open. Make sure that there is sufficient
clearance.<
Closing the tailgate lid:
Hold the button pressed.
Watch the closing movement to
ensure that the lid closing move-
ment is unobstructed and that no-one
could be trapped.
The movement is stopped when the
button is released.
If possible, drive only with the tailgate/
luggage compartment lid and rear
window fully closed, to prevent exhaust
gases from the entering the passenger
compartment. If you are obliged to drive
the car with the tailgate/luggage
compartment lid or rear window open:
> Close all other windows and the
sunroof
> Increase the air flow from the ventila-
tion outlets or air conditioning
considerably; see page 112 or 116.<
Interference
The remote control may be susceptible
to local interference from other systems
or equipment.
If this should occur, the car can be
opened at the door lock or tailgate
lock* with a master key.

Tensioning straps
Use the tensioning straps on the floor of

The principle
The alarm system reacts if:
> A door, the engine compartment, the
luggage compartment lid/tailgate or
the rear window are opened
> There is any movement inside the car
(interior movement detector)
> The car's angle changes, for instance
if an attempt is made to jack it up and
steal the wheels or to raise it prior to
towing away
> There is an interruption in the power
supply from the battery.
Depending on the national-market
version of the car, the alarm system
indicates unauthorised entry or
tampering in different ways:
> 30-second acoustic alarm
> Switching on the hazard warning
flashers for approx. five minutes*.
Activating and deactivating
Whenever the car is locked or
unlocked, either at the lock or with the
remote control, the alarm system is
activated or deactivated at the same
time.
You can arrange for various kinds
of signal to be generated as
confirmation that the system has been
activated and deactivated correctly.<
Even if the system has been activated,
you can open the luggage compartment
lid/tailgate by pressing the remote
control button (see page 36). When it is
closed, the lid/tailgate is automatically
protected again.
On certain national-market
versions, the alarm system can
only be operated by the remote control.
On these cars, unlocking with a key
triggers off the alarm.
To switch off the alarm:
Press the button (to unlock, see
page 35) or turn the ignition key to
position 1.<
Alarm system indicator light
> If the indicator light under the inside
mirror flashes steadily: the system is
activated
> If the indicator light flashes when the
system is being activated: not all
doors, lids or the rear window are
properly closed. Even if an item is not
closed fully, the remaining items are
protected and the indicator light
begins to flash steadily after 10
seconds. However, the interior move-
ment detector is not activated
> If the indicator light goes out when
the system is deactivated, no attempt
was made to tamper with the car
during your absence

After the alarm has stopped, the indi-
cator light once again flashes intermit-
tently.
Avoiding unintentional alarms
The tilt alarm sensor and the interior
movement detector can be switched off
together. This prevents false alarms, for
instance in two-level garages or when
the car travels by train or ferry:
Lock (activate) the system twice, by
pressing button 2 on the remote control
twice in succession; see page 36, or
perform the locking movement twice
with the key; see page 33.
The indicator light comes on briefly,
then flashes continuously. The tilt alarm
sensor and interior movement detector
are then switched off until the system is
deactivated again.
Interior movement detector
Before the interior movement detector
can operate correctly, the windows and
sliding/tilt sunroof must be closed.
However, switch off the interior move-
ment detector first (see previous
column) if
> Children or animals remain in the car
> Windows or the sunroof are to remain
open.
The tilt alarm sensor and the inte-
rior movement detector will be
switched off unintentionally if conven-
ient closure of the windows and sunroof
is interrupted during the first 10 seconds
and then restarted. In this case the
complete system must be deactivated
and re-activated.<
Opening and closing windows
From ignition key position 1:
> Press the rocker switch in until the
pressure point is felt:
The window continues to move for as
long as the rocker switch is pressed
> Press the toggle switch beyond the
pressure point:
The window then continues to move
automatically.
Press the switch briefly again to halt
the movement.

After the ignition is switched off:
> You can still operate the electric
windows for up to 15 minutes, unless
a front door was opened and closed
again. To open, press the rocker
switch beyond the pressure point.
When leaving the car, always take
out the ignition key and close the
doors, so that children cannot operate
the electric windows and possibly injure
themselves.<
For convenient operation using the
door lock or remote control, see
page 33 or 35.
Protective function
There is a contact strip on the inside of
each window surround at the top. If it is
pressed as the window closes, the
closing action is interrupted immedi-
ately and the window re-opens slightly.
Despite this protective function,
make sure that the window is not
obstructed as it closes; if this precau-
tion is not taken, the risk remains that
thin objects, for instance, may not
actuate the contact strip correctly.
The protective function is switched off
by pressing the switch beyond its
normal pressure point and holding it
there.<
Safety switch
This enables you to prevent the rear
door windows from being opened and
closed at the switches in the rear seat
area, for instance by children.
Always press the childproof safety
switch when children are on the
rear seat. Careless closure of electric
windows can cause injury.<

A seated position that suitably reflects
your requirements is a vital condition of
relaxed, fatigue-free driving. In conjunc-
tion with the seat belts and the airbags,
the correct seated position enhances
the passive safety of the car's occu-
pants in the event of an accident. You
should therefore observe the following
notes in order to maintain the protective
function of the car's safety systems.
For additional notes on carrying chil-
dren, see page 61.
Correct seated position in relation
to airbags
Keep your distance from the
airbags. Always grip the steering
wheel on the rim, to minimise the risk of
injury to the hands and arms in the
event of the airbag being triggered off.
No other persons, pets or objects
should be held or permitted to remain
between the airbags and yourself. Do
not use the front airbag cover on the
front passenger's side as a tray, nor
rest your feet or legs on it.<
The locations of the airbags and addi-
tional notes are given on page 60.
Safe travel with seat belt
Only one person should be
restrained by each seat belt;
babies and small children must not
travel sitting on the lap of an occupant
of the car. The belts should not be
twisted and must be positioned firmly
over the pelvis and shoulder, as close
to the body as possible. They should
not pass over hard or fragile objects in
your pockets. The seat belt must not
run across the wearer's neck, nor
should it be trapped or abraded by
coming into contact with sharp edges
or objects. Avoid bulky clothing and
remember to tauten the lap belt
frequently where it runs over the
shoulder. In the event of a head-on
collision, the lap belt could otherwise
slide over the hips and injure the lower
part of the body. In addition, the
restraining effect is reduced if the seat
belt is slack against the wearer's body.
Pregnant women should also wear the
seat belt, making sure that the lap strap
is well down on the hips and does not
press on the abdominal region of the
body.<
For details of operating the seat belts,
see page 54.
Before adjusting, note:
Do not reposition the driver's seat
while the car is in motion. The seat
could move unexpectedly, leading to
the driver losing control of the car, so
that an accident could be caused. Do
not recline the seat back too far when
the car is being driven (this applies in
particular to the front passenger), or
there will be a risk of "submarining"
under the seat belt, so that the belt
loses its full protective effect.
Do not slide the seats to the rear if the
car is standing on a slope, for instance
a ramp leading to a garage or a steep
hill. This could lead to the automatic
seat belt height adjuster becoming
disconnected.<

The adjustable upper section of the
seat back supports the shoulder area of
the seat occupant's body. It enables a
relaxed seat position to be found and
reduces the load on the shoulder
muscles.
To obtain the recommended optimum
settings:
Driver's and front passenger's side:
1. Tilt the upper part of the seat back
fully to the rear
2. Adjust to the most suitable position,
as described on page 49

3. Tilt the upper section of the seat
back forwards until adequate
shoulder support is obtained.
Passenger's seat in rest position:
1. Tilt the upper part of the seat back
fully to the rear
2. Set the seat angle to a slightly more
upright position
3. Recline the seat back slightly more to
the rear
4. Tilt the upper section of the seat
back forwards until adequate
shoulder support is obtained.
Correct the forward/back position
of the seat if necessary to ensure
that the seat belt still passes closely
over the wearer's body, otherwise its
protective action may be affected.<

Convex mirror*
The outer, aspherically curved section
of the mirror displays a larger field of
view, though slightly distorted, than the
inner, convex section. In this way, the
view to the rear is extended and the
blind spot, as it is known, is reduced in
size.
The mirror on the front
passenger's side is convex and
therefore reflected objects are closer
than they appear. It may be difficult to
estimate the precise distance at which
another vehicle is following your car.
The same applies to the aspherical
outer section of the mirrors.<
Electric mirror heating
Both mirrors are heated automatically in
ignition key position 2.

Inside and door mirrors,
automatic-dip*
These mirrors are dipped automatically
and revert automatically to the clear,
non-dimmed position when you engage
reverse gear or select R.
There are two photo-cells in the inside
mirror for this purpose. One photo-cell
is in the mirror glass (arrow), the other
slightly offset on the back of the mirror.

To ensure that the mirrors operate
correctly, keep the photo-cells clean
and do not place any obstructions
(including stickers or permits) between
the inside mirror and the windscreen.

1 Front airbags on the driver's and front
passenger's side
2 Head-level airbags on the driver's
and front passenger's side (for front
and rear*)
3 Side airbags on the driver's and front
passenger's side (front and rear*)
Protective effect
The front airbags protect the driver and
front passenger in the event of a frontal
crash, if the protective action of the
seat belts alone would be insufficient.
The head-level and side airbags
provide protection in the event of a
side-on collision. The side airbag which
inflates has the effect of supporting the
upper body from the side.
380de643
For details of the correct seated posi-
tion, see page 49.
The airbags are not triggered off in
minor accidents, nor if the car rolls
over or is struck from the rear.<
Never attach any material to the
airbag covers with adhesive, place
material over them or modify them in
any way. Do not dismantle the airbag
occupant restraint system. If the airbag
occupant restraint system develops
a fault, is shut down out of use or
has been triggered off in an accident,
have it checked, repaired or dismantled
only by BMW Service. Never make any
modifications to the individual compo-
nents of the system or its wiring. This
includes the upholstered covers on the
steering wheel, instrument panel, side
panels on front and rear doors and roof
struts as well as down the sides of the
roof liners. Do not remove the steering
wheel. In order to comply with valid
safety regulations, have airbag genera-
tors scrapped only by BMW Service.
Any careless or unskilled interference
with the system could lead to its failure
or to accidental triggering off with the
risk of injury. Avoid touching the
system's components immediately after
it has been triggered off, as there is a
risk of sustaining burns.<
Even if all these instructions are
complied with, injury to the face, arms
or hands as a result of the airbag
inflating cannot be entirely ruled out,
depending on the circumstances in
which an accident occurs. If the car's
occupants are unduly sensitive to the
ignition and inflation noise generated by
the airbag systems, their hearing may
be temporarily affected.

Indicator light
The indicator light in the instru-
ment panel confirms that the
airbag system is ready to
operate (from ignition key position 1
onwards).
System operational:
> The indicator light comes on briefly
and then goes out.
System defective:
> The indicator light does not come on,
or
> The indicator light comes on briefly,
goes out briefly and then comes on
again.
In the event of a fault, have the system
checked without delay by BMW
Service, otherwise there is a risk that
the airbags will not be triggered off
even if a sufficiently severe accident
occurs within the airbag range.
For children up to 12 years of age and
less than 150 cm (approx. 5 ft) tall, suit-
able approved restraint systems may
have to be installed; comply with local
regulations.
Small children up to about 18 months
old can be secured with a rear-facing
restraint system on the back seats,
using standard seat belts.
BMW Service can supply suitable child
restraint systems for every age group.
Please comply with the notes in the
installation instructions when using
these products.
All the seats of your BMW, except
for the driver's seat, are suitable
for the installation of universal child
restraint systems for all age groups,
provided these have been approved for
the age group in question.<
Do not allow children to travel on
the front passenger's seat,
including when sitting on the lap of
another person or wearing a child
restraint system, as there is the risk of
injury if the airbags are triggered off.
BMW Service can provide information
on the temporary disabling of the
airbags on the front passenger's side
and on changing the belt system on the
front passenger's side.
Under no circumstances are child
restraint systems to be modified, as
their protective effect may otherwise
be impaired.
If the car has rear side airbags, make
sure that any child's seat is installed
correctly and not too near the airbags in
the door trim panels. Do not allow the
child to lean out of the child's seat
towards the door trim, as serious inju-
ries could occur if the airbag were to be
triggered off.
Observe the notes on installation and
use provided by the manufacturer of
the child restraint system, to uphold its
protective effect. If damaged or
subjected to strain in an accident, have
the child restraint system and possibly
the belt system used to secure it,
together with other accessory items,
renewed by BMW Service and the belt
anchorages checked.<

How it works
You have probably wished at times that
individual functions of your car could be
individually selected or adjusted to suit
your own personal preferences. When
developing the car, BMW therefore
"designed in" a number of freely
programmable options for the car,
which BMW Service will gladly adjust
as you wish.
463de029
There are "Car Memory" and "Key
Memory" settings, the former relating to
the car itself, the latter to your personal
requirements. You can have two
different basic settings selected if two
people regularly drive the car. This
presupposes that each person has his
or her own remote control key.
By means of data exchange with the
key, the car identifies the user when the
car is unlocked and performs the
necessary adjustments.
Coloured adhesive labels are supplied
with the keys so that they can be identi-
fied by the users.

What can be selected
BMW Service will gladly inform you of
the facilities available with Car Memory
and Key Memory. A few examples are
given below.
Examples for Car Memory:
> Various signals to confirm that the car
has been locked/unlocked
> Deactivating/activating the headlight
courtesy delay feature
> Activating/deactivating the daytime
driving lights.
> Adjusting the units of measurement
for the display of outside temperature
and distance driven on the instrument
panel.
Examples for Key Memory:
> Locking the vehicle after setting off
> Automatic adjustment of the driver's
seat, door mirror and steering wheel
position to the key user's preferred
settings when the car is unlocked
> When unlocking, releasing first the
driver's door, then the entire vehicle.
At the appropriate points in this
Owner's Handbook you will find
this symbol, as an indication that
special settings as described above are
available.<

After the ignition has been switched off
(ignition key turned back to position 0
or removed), the radio functions will
remain available for approximately
20 minutes. Switch the radio back on
for these functions.
Automatic transmission cars: do
not move the selector lever away
from position P until the engine is
running (ignition key position 2).
Before the ignition key can be returned
to position 0 or pulled out, the auto-
matic transmission selector lever must
be moved to position P (interlock).<
Steering released
A slight movement of the steering
wheel often makes it easier to turn the
key in the ignition from 0 to 1.
Individual electrical consumers can
then operate.
Before starting
> Apply the handbrake
> Move the gear lever to neutral (or
automatic transmission selector to P)
> At low temperatures, depress the
clutch pedal.
Never run the engine in an
enclosed space. The exhaust gas
contains carbon monoxide, which is
colourless and odourless, but highly
toxic. Inhaling exhaust gas constitutes a
severe health risk and can lead to loss
of consciousness with fatal conse-
quences.
Do not leave the car unattended with
the engine running, as it then consti-
tutes a considerable potential hazard.<

Cars with spark-ignition engine
Do not press the accelerator pedal
while starting the engine.
Allow the starter motor to run for a
reasonable time, but for no more
than about 20 seconds. As soon as the
engine fires, release the ignition key.
BMW 535iA, 540iA:
Your BMW is equipped with a conven-
ient-start system. It is sufficient to turn
the ignition key briefly to position 3 (to
operate the starter motor), then to
release it.
The starter then runs automatically for a
predetermined period, and cuts out as
soon as the engine has started.
If the battery voltage is low, automatic
starting cannot be activated, or the
function is interrupted. The engine can
be jump started (see page 173).<
Do not warm up the engine with the car
at a standstill; it is preferable to set off
straight away, driving at moderate
engine speeds.
If the engine does not start at the first
attempt, for instance when it is
extremely hot or cold:
> Depress the accelerator pedal
halfway while starting the engine.
Cold starts at very low ambient temper-
atures (below approx. Â–15 6) at high
altitude (more than 1,000 m (approx.
3,250 ft) above sea level):
> On the first occasion, take longer
over the starting operation (approx.
10 seconds)
Excessively lengthy or frequent
operation of the starter motor at
short intervals can result in damage to
the catalytic converter.<
Make sure that when driving the
car, standing with the engine
running or when parking, no easily
flammable material (hay, grass, leaves
etc.) comes into contact with the hot
exhaust system. It could ignite and
cause a fire, with the risk of severe
injuries or damage.<
Cars with diesel engine
When the engine is cold:
> Hold the ignition key in position 2
until the preheat indicator light or
display goes out
> Start the engine.
At extremely low temperatures, the
starter motor may have to be run for
up to 40 seconds.
When the engine is warm:
> The preheat indicator light or display
does not come on. Start the engine
immediately.
Movement of the accelerator pedal has
no influence on the starting process.
Do not allow the engine to warm up at a
standstill, but drive off as soon as
possible, using moderate engine
speeds.
Bleeding the fuel system: even if the
fuel tank has been run dry, the fuel
system does not normally need to be
bled.
If you nevertheless encounter difficul-
ties in starting the engine:
> Run the starter motor for approx.
20 seconds.

Turn the ignition key back to 1 or 0.
BMW 520d, 525d, 530d:
When the engine is cold, a fuel-burning
auxiliary heater is used to warm the
car's interior more rapidly. Its exhaust
fumes are discharged under the door
sill on the driver's side.
If the engine is stopped before it has
reached its regular operating tempera-
ture, the auxiliary heater continues to
run for a short time, and therefore
produces exhaust fumes.
Never remove the ignition key
while the car is still moving, as
otherwise the steering lock will engage.
When leaving the car, always remove
the ignition key and lock the ignition
lock.
Manual-gearbox cars:
When parking on a slope, apply the
handbrake, because even engaging
first or reverse gear may not reliably
prevent the car from rolling away.
Automatic transmission cars:
Select position P.<
The handbrake is primarily intended for
preventing a stationary vehicle from
rolling away, and acts on the rear
wheels.
Applying
The lever engages automatically and
the indicator light on the instrument
panel lights up in ignition key
position 2, see page 18.
Releasing
Raise slightly, press the knob and move
the lever down.
390de714
In exceptional cases, if the hand-
brake has to be used to slow or
stop the car, do not pull the lever up too
hard. Keep the knob on the lever held in
all the time.
Too violent an application of the hand-
brake could over-brake the rear wheels
and cause the rear of the car to skid.
The brake lights do not come on when
the handbrake is applied.
Manual-gearbox cars:
When parking on a slope, apply the
handbrake, because even engaging
first or reverse gear may not reliably
prevent the car from rolling away.
Automatic transmission cars:
Select position P.<
To prevent corrosion or an imbalance
between the brakes on the right and left
side, apply the handbrake lightly from
time to time when coasting to a stand-
still, for instance at traffic lights,
provided that it is safe to do so.

Reverse
Engage only when the car is standing

Never try to prevent the car from
rolling back on an uphill gradient
by slipping the clutch; always apply the
handbrake. A clutch that is allowed to
slip will wear rapidly.<

Before moving the selector lever
away from P or N with the car at a
standstill, you must press the brake
pedal down to release the lever (shift-

Above about 30 km/h (approx. 20 mph),
you can memorise and call up the car's
road speed.
You can use the cruise control if the
system is activated with the engine
running.
Activating the system
From ignition key position 2:
Press the button; the indicator light in
the instrument panel (see page 19)
comes on. You can then use the cruise
control.
Do not use the cruise control on
twisting roads, in heavy traffic
which prevents a constant speed from
being maintained or if the road surface
is slippery (snow, rain, ice) or loose
(stones, sand).<
Deactivating the system
Press the button as often as necessary
until the indicator light in the instrument
panel goes out.
The cruise control is also deactivated
when the ignition key is turned to posi-
tion 0.
The memorised speed is deleted.
Maintaining and memorising
speed, accelerating
Press button (+) briefly:
The car's actual speed is maintained
and memorised. Each time the button is
pressed briefly again, road speed is
increased by approx. 1 km/h.
Hold button (+) pressed
The car accelerates without the accel-
erator pedal being touched. As soon as
you release the switch, the speed the
car has reached will be maintained and
memorised.
If engine braking alone is insuffi-
cient on a downhill gradient, the
controlled speed may be exceeded. It
may also prove impossible to maintain
with the available engine power on
uphill gradients.<

76n	*
Decelerating
Press button (Â–) briefly:
Every time you press the button, road
speed drops by approx. 1 km/h if the
cruise control is already in use.
Hold button (Â–) pressed:
The car slows down by automatically
closing the throttle if the cruise control
is already in use. As soon as you
release the switch, the speed the car
has reached will be maintained and
memorised.
Cancelling the cruise control
When activated, press button: the indi-
cator light remains lit. You can re-acti-
vate cruise control as required, by
calling up the speed last memorised.
In addition, you interrupt the cruise
control function automatically:
> When braking
> When operating the clutch or when
moving the automatic transmission
selector lever from D to N
> If the selected speed is exceeded or
not reached for a lengthy period, for
instance by depressing the acceler-
ator pedal.
Calling up memorised speed
Press the button:
The speed last memorised is recalled
and maintained once it has been
reached again.

The principle
PDC assists you when manoeuvring
into a parking space. Audible warning
signals indicate when the car is
approaching an obstacle. Four ultra-
sonic sensors in the front and four in
the rear bumper measure the distance
from the nearest object. The range of
the sensors at the front of the car and at
the two rear corners ends approx.
60 cm (approx. 2 ft) away from the
bumper. The centre sensors at the rear
have a range of approx. 1.50 m (approx.
5 ft).
If the car is towing a trailer, the rear
sensors clearly cannot supply sensible
signals and therefore remain switched
off.
Automatic function
In ignition key position 2, the system is
activated automatically after approx. 1
second when reverse gear is selected
or the automatic transmission selector
lever moved to R.
Switching on manually
Press the button, the indicator light
comes on.
After a distance of approx. 50 m
(approx. 164 ft) has been covered or a
speed of approx. 30 km/h (approx.
20 mph) is exceeded, the system is de-
activated and the indicator light goes
out. Switch the system on again as
necessary.
Switching off manually
Press the button again.
390de701
Audible warning signals
The distance from an obstruction is
indicated by a higher intermittent
audible signal for the front end, and a
lower-pitched intermittent audible
signal for the rear end. The closer the
car approaches the obstruction, the
more rapid the sequence of signals.
When the distance is less than 30 cm
(approx. 12 in), the signal becomes
continuous.
The signal is interrupted after approx.
3 seconds if you are driving parallel to a
wall.
The system has developed a malfunc-
tion if:
The indicator light flashes and a contin-
uous tone is emitted briefly
> When you switch on PDC at the
button
> When you engage reverse or selector
lever position R for the first time after
switching on the ignition
> If the malfunction occurs while PDC
is active.
Switch off the system and have the
cause of the malfunction rectified by
BMW Service.

PDC is no substitute for your
personal assessment of obstruc-
tions. The sensors have certain "dead
areas" in which objects cannot always
be detected. In addition, the identifica-
tion of objects may not be possible if
the physical limits of the ultrasonic
measuring principle are exceeded, for
instance in the case of trailer tow
hitches and towbars, and also other
thin or wedge-shaped objects.
Loud sound sources such as loud
radios can overpower the PDC signal
tone.<
Keep the sensors clean and free
from ice, so that they always
operate reliably.
Do not spray the sensors for any length
of time with a high-pressure cleaning
jet. Keep such jets at least 10 cm
(approx. 4 in) away from the sensors.<
Automatic Stability Control plus
Traction (ASC+T)/Dynamic
Stability Control (DSC)*
These systems ensure additional
dynamic stability, particularly when
accelerating and cornering.
The DSC adds to the advantages of
ASC+T. In addition to achieving
optimum dynamic stability when accel-
erating and starting from a standstill,
a gain in stability is obtained when
cornering. Note however that the car
always remains subject to the limits
imposed by the basic laws of dynamics.
The system is in operation whenever
the engine has been started.

Indicator light
The indicator light on the instru-
ment panel goes out shortly
after the engine has been
started. See page 18.
If the indicator light flashes:
The system is active, and regulates
tractive and braking forces.
If the indicator light does not go out
after starting the engine, or remains on
during a journey:
The system is either defective or has
been switched off at the button
provided. The car can be driven
normally without ASC+T/DSC. Please
visit BMW Service for repair work.
Switching off
Press the button, the indicator light
remains on all the time.
Depending on the car's equipment, the
button is marked either ASC or DSC.
In the following exceptional situations it
may be best to switch off ASC+T/DSC
for a short time:
> If the car has to be rocked out of a
hollow or a soft surface, or started in
deep snow or on a loose surface
> If snow chains are fitted.
390de702
Switching on again
Press the button again; the indicator
light will go out.
Not even ASC+T/DSC can over-
come the laws of physics. It is
therefore the driver's responsibility to
adopt a suitable driving style in every
situation. Avoid taking any risks on
account of the additional safety
afforded by this system.<

Dynamic Brake Control (DBC)*
DBC is part of DSC.
If the brake pedal is pressed down
rapidly, this system automatically
boosts the braking force to a maximum
and thus helps to pull the car up in the
shortest possible distance when a full
brake application is made. It also
makes full use of the advantages
offered by ABS.
Maintain pressure on the brake pedal
during the entire brake application. If
the brake pedal is released, DBC will be
switched off.
This system automatically ensures that
movement of the road wheels is
damped according to the car's needs,
and therefore enhances both ride
comfort and safety.
Automatic control
Automatic control is activated each
time the engine is started. It takes effect
over the entire road-speed range and
regardless of the load on the car. If the
influencing factors change (road
surface quality or operating conditions
such as steering, braking etc.), the
damping action is modified automati-
cally in a fraction of a second to suit the
new situation.
390de703
Sport program
In ignition key position 2, press the
button; the indicator light will come on.
The Sport program should be selected

The self-levelling suspension
warning light comes on and the
Check Control displays the
"SELFLEVEL SUSP.INACT": the self-
levelling suspension is malfunctioning.
Stop the car and examine it. If the body
is distinctly lower at the back than at
the front, and possibly standing at an
angle (for instance, lower at the left
than at the right), take it to the nearest
BMW Service. Drive cautiously while
the car is in this condition. The car's
ground clearance is reduced and its
ride comfort below the usual standard.
Even if the car appears to be at its
normal ride height and attitude, always
take it to BMW Service if a malfunction
is displayed.
The principle
RDC monitors the air pressure in all four
tyres, including when the car is being
driven. The system reports any sudden
loss of pressure in one or more tyres.
So that the system can identify the
correct tyre pressures, first check these
against the tyre pressure tables starting
on page 25 and correct them if neces-
sary. Then activate the system.
This indicator light on the instru-
ment panel or the Check Control
informs you whenever tyre pres-
sure is not normal.
Activating the system
1. Turn the ignition key to position 2
(do not start the engine)
2. Keep the button pressed in until the
yellow indicator light on the instru-
ment panel comes on for a few
seconds or the Check Control
displays "SET TYRE PRESSURE"
3. After the car has been driven for a
few minutes, RDC adopts the actual
tyre pressure as the desired value to
be monitored.
You do not need to repeat this proce-
dure unless the tyre pressures have
been corrected in the meantime. The
system will be activated automatically
each time the ignition key is in
position 2 and therefore each time the
car is driven.

If the tyre pressure has dropped too far
in the course of time (quite normal on
any tyre), the indicator light comes on
yellow or the message "CHECK TYRE
PRESSURE" appears in the Check
Control.
This is to remind you that the tyre pres-
sure should be corrected to the speci-
fied values again as soon as possible.
If you are asked to check tyre
pressures shortly after correcting
them, the corrected pressure values
were not plausible. Please check the
tyre pressures again and correct them
to the values specified in the tyre pres-
sure table. After this, re-activate the
system.<

If you suffer a tyre defect involving loss
of pressure, the red indicator comes on,
or the message "TYRE DEFECT"
appears in the Check Control. In addi-
tion, a gong sounds.
When this occurs, slow down to a stop
immediately, avoiding harsh braking
and steering manoeuvres. Replace the
defective wheel with tyre.
The spare wheel supplied as
standard with your car is
equipped with the necessary RDC elec-
tronics and is therefore also monitored
automatically after fitting, when the
system has been activated.<
RDC is unable to warn the driver
of sudden, severe tyre damage
caused by outside influences.<
Have your tyres changed by BMW
Service.
BMW Service has the necessary infor-

on weather conditions, the windscreen
may fog over momentarily when the
engine is started. Switching on the air
conditioning system reduces this effect.
Moisture condensate forms in the
air conditioning and is discharged
underneath the car. Traces of water on
the ground are therefore normal.<
Recirculated air mode
If there are strong smells
outside, you can shut off the
supply of outside air for temporary
periods. The air inside the car is then
recirculated.
If your car has a multifunctional steering
wheel with recirculated air button, this
can also be used to shut off the
incoming airflow (see page 20).
If the windows mist up in recircu-
lating mode, switch this mode off
and, if necessary, also increase the air
supply.<
Auxiliary heater
BMW 520d, 525d, 530d:
When the engine is cold, there is a fuel-
burning auxiliary heater for warming up
the car's interior more rapidly. Its
exhaust fumes are discharged under
the door sill on the driver's side.
If the engine is stopped before it has
reached its regular operating tempera-
ture, the auxiliary heater continues to
run for a short time, and therefore
produces exhaust fumes.

A pleasant interior temperature
Use the automatic system, i.e. switch
on AUTO button 6. Select the interior
temperature which you find most
agreeable.
The description below tells you how to
obtain various settings which may be
individually preferred.
When your car is unlocked with
the remote control using a
personal key, your preferred air condi-
tioning settings will be restored auto-
matically.<
Automatic air distribution
The AUTO program
handles the setting of air
distribution for you and also adapts
your temperature preferences to suit
ambient conditions (summer, winter).
Individual air distribution
You can also select your
preferred combination of air
distribution settings and
thus switch off the AUTO
program; the automatic air
supply, however, is automatically main-
tained. Air flows on to the windows
,
to the upper body zone
and to the
footwell
. However, you can switch
the automatic air distribution back on
by pressing the AUTO button.
Temperature
You can also select your
own individual temperature
setting on the driver's and
front passenger's sides of the car. The
displayed values are a guide to the
actual interior temperature. 22 6 is
recommended as a pleasant setting,
whether or not the air conditioning is
in operation. During the journey, the
chosen temperature is reached as
quickly as possible Â– in summer and in
winter Â– and maintained at a constant
value.
Air supply
In the AUTO program, air
supply is controlled auto-
matically; AUTO appears in display 9 Â–
see the summary on page 114. Using
"+" and "Â–" you can vary the air supply.
Your entry is indicated by a bar display,
the automatic air supply is switched off
and the automatic airflow distribution
system remains unchanged. However,
you can switch the automatic air supply
system back on by pressing the AUTO
button.
In the lowest fan setting, if you press
"Â–", all displays disappear: the blower,
heater and air conditioning are
switched off and the air supply is
closed. The automatic air conditioning
can be switched on again by pressing
any button (except MAX button 16).
Defrosting and demisting
windows
This program removes ice
and condensation quickly
from the windscreen and from the side
windows.

Air conditioning
Air is cooled and dried
when the air conditioning
is switched on, then is heated back up
to suit the temperature setting.
Depending on weather conditions, the
windscreen may fog over momentarily
when the engine is started. Switching
on the air conditioning system reduces
this effect.
Moisture condensate forms in the
air conditioning and is discharged
underneath the car. Traces of water on
the ground are therefore normal.<
Maximum cooling effect
This program enables you
rapidly to achieve
maximum cooling effect when the
engine is running, at outside tempera-
tures of approx. 5 6 upwards.
The temperature displays 9 jump to
16 6, the system switches to the recir-
culated-air mode and air emerges at
the maximum flow rate from the ventila-
tion grilles only. Be sure to keep these
grilles open when you select this
program.
Automatic Recirculated Air
Control (AUC)
If the air outside the car
has an unpleasant odour
or contains pollutants, you can shut off
the supply to the interior of the car
temporarily. The air inside the car is
then recirculated. Obtain the desired
operating mode by pressing the button
as often as necessary.
> Indicator lights off: airflow from
outside the car
> Left indicator light on Â– AUC opera-
tion: the system identifies pollutants
in the outside air and shuts off the
supply if necessary. The air inside the
car is then recirculated.
After this, the automatic system
switches between outside air supply
and recirculated air according to the
available air quality
> Right indicator light on: the outside
air supply is permanently shut off.
The air inside the car is recirculated.
If your car has a multifunctional steering
wheel with recirculated air switch (see
page 20), you can use it to change
between "Off" and the recirculated air
mode (or between AUC and the recircu-
lated air mode).
If the windows mist up in recircu-
lated mode, switch this mode off
and, if necessary, also increase the air
supply.<

Heated rear window
When the heated rear
window is switched on, the
indicator light comes on. The heated
rear window switches itself off automat-
ically.
Residual heat utilisation
Heat from the engine is
stored and used to heat
the car's interior when the ignition is
switched off, for instance when waiting
at a level crossing.
In ignition key position 1, you can alter
the automatic air conditioning settings.
In ignition key position 0, the heated air
is directed automatically to the wind-
screen, side windows and footwells.
This function can be activated if
the outside temperature is below
approx. 15 6, the engine is at its
regular operating temperature and the
battery is sufficiently charged. The LED
in the button comes on if all these
conditions are met.<
Auxiliary heater
BMW 520d, 525d, 530d:
When the engine is cold, there is a fuel-
burning auxiliary heater for warming up
the car's interior more rapidly. Its
exhaust fumes are discharged under
the door sill on the driver's side.
If the engine is stopped before it has
reached its regular operating tempera-
ture, the auxiliary heater continues to
run for a short time, and therefore
produces exhaust fumes.

If your car has an auxiliary fuel-burning
heater, it is also equipped with inde-
pendent ventilation control. Cars are
also supplied with independent ventila-
tion control only.
Both systems are operated via the
Multi-Information Display (MID) (see
page 88) or the on-board computer.
There is a separate Owner's Handbook
for the on-board computer.
Two different switch-on times can be
preselected, so that you can be sure
that the car's interior is warm when it is
next entered. Snow and ice are also
easier to remove from the windows.
The auxiliary heater runs for 30 minutes.
It can also be switched on and off
directly. Since its current consumption
is high, it should not be run twice in
succession unless there has in the
meantime been an opportunity to
recharge the car's battery by driving the
car.
The auxiliary fuel-burning heater can be
operated at outside temperatures
below 16 6 if the switch-on time is
preselected, or switched on directly at
any outside temperature. This only
applies when the car is driven,
however, until the engine has reached
its regular operating temperature.
The heated air is directed automatically
to the windscreen, side windows and
footwell; maximum heating output is
always used.
In ignition key position 1 you can adjust
the interior temperature, air supply and
air distribution.
The auxiliary heater continues to run for
a short period after it has been
switched off (indicator light out).
Even during the warm season of
the year the auxiliary heater
should be switched on directly about
once a month, then switched off again
after about 5 minutes.<
Do not operate the auxiliary heater
in confined spaces (closed
rooms). Always switch off the auxiliary
heater before refuelling the car.<
Ventilates the interior of the car and
lowers its temperature by means of the
(automatic) air conditioning blower.
The independent ventilation control is
operated via the Multi-Information
Display (MID) (see page 88) or the on-
board computer. There is a separate
Owner's Handbook for the on-board
computer.
Two different switch-on times can be
preselected; the ventilation system then
runs for 30 minutes. It can also be
switched on and off directly. Since its
current consumption is high, it should
not be run twice in succession unless
there has in the meantime been an
opportunity to recharge the car's
battery by driving the car.
Independent ventilation control can be
operated at any outside temperature
above 16 6 if the switch-on time is
preselected, or switched on directly at
any outside temperature, but not when
the car is being driven.
Air emerges from the variable-flow,
controlled-direction outlets for the
upper body zone on the fascia. These
outlets must therefore remain open if
the independent ventilation system is to
be used.
In ignition key position 1, the airflow
volume and air distribution are adjusted
in the same way as for auxiliary heating.

4 Switching off
You can switch the auxiliary heater on
and off with the remote control handset
provided that the outside temperature
is below 16 6. The reception signals
are sufficiently strong for the remote
control to operate on average at a
range of up to 350 m (approx. 1,150 ft).
390de155
Switching on
1. Extend aerial 2 fully
2. Press button 1. Indicator light 3
flashes three times, then emits short
rhythmic flashes for the remainder of
the operating period (max. 30
minutes)
3. Push the aerial back in, but only after
the first three regular flashes have
been seen.
Switching off
1. Extend aerial 2 fully
2. Press button 4. The indicator light
flashes three times and then goes
out
3. Finally, push the aerial back in.
Renewing the battery and operating a
new transmitter: see page 166.
The best signal transmission is
obtained if the remote control is
held either vertical or horizontal. When
switching on and off, do not touch the
aerial or point it at the car. The remote
control only operates the auxiliary
heater if this is not already running after
a preselected time input or direct
switch-on.<
Interference
Operation of the remote control may be
interfered with by outside equipment
operating on the same frequency.

122n
The principle
The integrated universal remote control
replaces up to three hand-held remote
controls for various other systems or
devices, for example a gate opener,
alarm or door locking system. The inte-
grated universal remote control identi-
fies and "learns" the signals transmitted
by the original control devices.
The signal from an original hand-held
remote control can be programmed to
one of the three channel buttons. After
this, the programmed channel button
will operate the system in question.
Transmission of the signal is shown by
the indicator light.
Before selling the car, the channel
buttons should be erased, as described
on page 124.
During the programming operation
and before a programmed system
is operated with the integrated
universal remote control, make sure
that no persons, animals or objects are
within the system's range of movement,
in order to avoid possible injury or
damage. Comply also with the safety
instructions supplied with the original
remote control.<
The original hand-held remote
control
If this symbol appears on the
pack or in the instructions
supplied with the original
remote control, you can assume that it
will be compatible with the integrated
universal remote control.
Checking for alternating code
To check whether the original handheld
remote control is equipped with an
alternating code system, either study
the instructions supplied with it or
program a channel button as described
on page 123, left-hand column, under
the heading "Programming".
After this, hold down the programmed
channel button on the integrated
universal remote control. If the indicator
light on the integrated universal remote
control flashes rapidly for two seconds
and then remains on, the original
control device uses an alternating code.
In this case, program the channel
buttons as described on page 123,
right-hand column under the heading
"Programming an alternating-code
transmitter".
If you have any queries in this
connection, please contact BMW
Service.<

Do not exceed the car's gross weight
limit or the permissible axle loads (see
page 185), otherwise the car's oper-
ating safety may be endangered and
the construction and use regulations
infringed.
Heavy or hard objects should not be
carried loose inside the car, since they
could be dislodged by heavy braking,

When loading the roof rack, ensure that
the specified roof load limit, the car's
gross weight limit and the axle loads
are not exceeded.
The relevant figures are shown in
"Technical data", page 185.
The roof load must be uniformly distrib-
uted and should not be too large in
area. Heavy items of luggage should
always be placed at the bottom. Make
sure that sufficient clearance is avail-
able for raising the sliding/tilt sunroof
and that no objects extend into the
hinge-up area of the tailgate.
Fasten loads to the roof rack
securely, as they could endanger

Fitting
First install the cover flap at the top with
the groove in the aperture, then press in
the lower area (arrow).
390de758
Trailer tow hitch*
The suspension settings of your BMW
afford optimum safety, ride comfort and
sports performance.
If a trailer tow hitch has been fitted by
the manufacturer, the vehicle will also
be equipped with uprated suspension*
at the rear as standard. This compen-
sates for the weight of the tow hitch
and also ensures optimum road behav-
iour when the trailer is not being towed.
If a trailer tow hitch* is retrofitted, it
must be of a type approved by BMW
and be expertly installed by BMW
Service. You are recommended to have
uprated suspension fitted as well.
On models with self-levelling suspen-
sion, the trailer-towing suspension
need not be retrofitted.
BMW does not approve of any other
suspension systems offered by the
automotive trade for trailer towing
purposes.

138n	
	
Look after a detachable ball end in
accordance with its manufacturer's
operating instructions, to ensure that it
can be fitted and removed without diffi-
culty.
If a trailer tow hitch is installed,
the self-regenerating action of the
rear bumper system may not be able to
take effect.<
The use of a stabilising device can be
recommended, particularly if the trailer
is a heavy one. Information can be
obtained from BMW Service.
Nose weight
This is the weight which the trailer
towbar exerts downwards on the ball
head of the car's trailer tow hitch (it can
for example be measured with bath-
room scales).
In Germany: a minimum nose weight of
25 kg (55 lb) is laid down by law.
The nose weight limit (see page 185)
may not be exceeded, but should
always be utilised to the full, in partic-
ular when towing large, heavy trailers
which are prone to swinging from side
to side.
The trailer's nose weight affects the
towing vehicle, and must not lead to the
car's gross weight limit or rear axle load
limit being exceeded if a trailer is being
towed. The car's payload limit is
reduced by the weight of the trailer tow
hitch and, if a trailer is being towed, by
its nose weight. The gross weight limit
for the combined car and trailer must
not be exceeded.
Towing a trailer
The permissible trailer load and nose
weight (towbar downthrust) are stated
in "Technical data", page 185. The
trailer load limit is also entered in the
car's registration papers. Consult BMW
Service regarding increased trailer
weights.
Loads:
When loading the trailer, make sure that
the weight is kept as low down as
possible and stowed if possible close to
the axle.
A low centre of trailer gravity makes the
outfit much more stable and safe to
drive.
Do not exceed either the trailer's gross
weight or the specified trailer load limit
for the car. The smaller value is the limit
which should be adhered to.
Before purchasing a trailer it is advis-
able to obtain a declaration from the
trailer manufacturer concerning the
effective trailer weight and trailer
payload limit.

Gradients:
In the interests of safety and to avoid
holding up other traffic, do not attempt
to climb gradients steeper than 12X.
If an application is made to tow a
heavier trailer, the limit is 8X.
BMW 520d, 525d, 530d:
On vehicles with automatic trans-
mission, engage position "D" when
climbing long inclines, otherwise
bubbles may form in the fuel as a result
of overheating, causing the engine to
stall.<
Downhill gradients:
Special care must be taken when
descending gradients, as a trailer is
more susceptible to snaking. Always
shift down to the next-lower gear
before downhill gradients Â– or as far
down as 1st gear if necessary Â– and
drive down the hill slowly.
Speed limit:
The maximum speed limit when towing
a trailer is 80 km/h (50 mph) in
Germany, and similar speed limits apply
in other countries also.
If the trailer begins to snake, the outfit
can only be stabilised by braking hard
immediately. Only attempt to steer out
of the situation if this is absolutely
essential; make any steering move-
ments as gently as possible.
Tyre pressures:
Check the car's and the trailer's tyre
pressures most carefully. For the trailer,
comply with the manufacturer's recom-
mendations.
Outside mirrors:
Two outside mirrors which bring both
rear corners of the trailer into your field
of view are required by law. Mirrors of
this kind can be obtained from BMW
Service.
Electrical system
Higher electrical consumption can
be expected if a trailer (caravan) is
towed. Try to avoid operating electrical
equipment for too long at a time, in
order to limit the drain on the car's
battery.<
Before starting a journey, check
that the trailer's rear lights are
operating correctly.<

142n
Please comply with the following
instructions, which are intended to
ensure that your car achieves its
optimum operating life and economy.
Engine and final drive
Up to 2,000 km (approx. 1,300 miles):
drive at varying road and engine
speeds, but do not exceed the
following maximum values:
> Cars with spark-ignition (petrol)
engine
6-cylinder: 4,500 rpm
or 160 km/h (100 mph)
8-cylinder: 4,500 rpm
or 170 km/h (105 mph)
> Cars with diesel engine
3,500 rpm
or 150 km/h (93 mph)
Observe the national speed limits.
Avoid full throttle and do not use the
automatic transmission "kick-down".
From a distance reading of 2,000 km
(approx. 1,300 miles) onwards, engine
and road speeds can be gradually
increased.
Comply with these running-in instruc-
tions again if an exchange engine or
final drive is fitted later in the car's life.
Tyres
New tyres do not achieve their full road
grip immediately, for production
reasons. You should therefore drive in a
restrained manner for the first 300 km
(approx. 200 miles).
Braking system
Brake pads and discs do not achieve a
favourable wear and contact pattern
until the car has covered about 500 km
(approx. 300 miles).
Clutch
The clutch likewise needs to be run in
for about 500 km (approx. 300 miles)
before it will operate with maximum
efficiency. Operate the clutch gently
while running it in.
Brakes:
Do not rest your foot on the brake
pedal while the car is in motion. Even
slight continuous pressure on the brake
pedal could cause overheating, brake
pad wear or even brake system failure.
Aquaplaning:
When driving on wet or slushy surfaces,
reduce speed to prevent a wedge of
water from forming between the tyre
and the road. This situation, known as
aquaplaning, means that the tyre can
actually lose contact completely with
the road surface, so that the car can
neither be steered nor can the brakes
be properly applied.
Water on the road:
When there is water on the roads, drive
through it only to a max. depth of 30 cm
(approx. 12 in), and no faster than
walking pace, otherwise the engine,
electrical system and transmission may
be damaged.

Rear-window shelf:
Do not leave any heavy or hard objects
on the shelf, as they could be dislodged
by heavy braking or a sudden avoid-
ance manoeuvre, and endanger the
car's occupants.
Coat hooks:
Items of clothing hung from the hooks
must not obstruct the driver's view. Do
not hang any heavy objects from the
hooks, as these could endanger the
car's occupants in the event of heavy
braking or a sudden avoidance
manoeuvre.<
The principle
The antilock brake system (ABS)
prevents the wheels from locking when
the brakes are applied, and thus
increases active safety.
Braking with ABS
You use ABS most effectively by
applying maximum brake pressure in
situations which call for this ("full
braking"). Since the vehicle remains
steerable, you can avoid obstacles by
turning the steering wheel as smoothly
as possible.
The pulsating sensation at the brake
pedal, combined with the sound of the
hydraulic system operating, indicates
that ABS is intervening.

144n2'	
)
Brake fluid level
If the brake fluid level is too low and if
brake pedal travel is much greater than
usual, one of the two hydraulic brake
circuits may have failed.
Visit your nearest BMW Service.
Increased brake pedal pressure
may be necessary, the car may "pull" to
one side and longer braking distances
may be required. Modify your driving
style accordingly.<
Disc brakes
If the car covers only short distances,
stands out of use for lengthy periods
and is only used infrequently or gently,
corrosion and dirt will affect the brake
discs and pads more severely, because
the minimum loads needed to achieve
the desired self-cleaning effect of the
disc brakes have not been reached.
When the brakes are applied, corroded
discs tend to judder, and even lengthy
brake applications usually fail to elimi-
nate this effect entirely.
In wet conditions or heavy rain, it is a
good idea to apply the brakes lightly
from time to time. When doing so, make
sure that no other road-user is endan-
gered. The resulting heat dries the
brake discs and pads. The full braking
effect will then be immediately available
if required.
You should select the gear which calls
for the least use of the brakes when
descending long or steep hills. This
avoids overburdening the brakes and
therefore the risk of brake fade.
Never drive with the clutch pedal
held down, with the gear lever or
selector lever in neutral or with the
engine switched off; engine braking
action will not be present with the
gearbox or transmission in neutral and
there will be no power assistance to the
brakes or steering while the engine is
switched off.
Make sure that the full travel of the
brake, clutch and accelerator pedals is
not obstructed by floor mats, carpets or
other objects.<
Brake pads
In the interests of your own safety,
use only brake pads approved by
BMW for use on a specified type of
vehicle. If BMW has not approved the
brake pads it cannot assess their suita-
bility or provide any guarantee of road
safety.<

Information for your safety
The radial-ply tyres approved for your
car are matched to its characteristics
and ensure not only optimum road
safety but also the desired level of ride
comfort.
The condition of the tyres and mainte-
nance of the correct tyre pressures not
only influence tyre life but are also deci-
sive factors in ride quality and above all
in road safety.
Incorrect pressures are often a
cause of tyre problems. They also
have a considerable effect on the road-
holding of your BMW. Check tyre pres-
sures Â– including the spare wheel Â– on a
regular basis (see page 24), but at least
twice a month and before setting out on
any long journeys. Incorrect tyre pres-
sures can adversely affect the car's
roadholding and cause tyre damage,
which could result in an accident.<
Tyre tread Â– tyre damage
Inspect the tyres frequently for damage,
the presence of foreign bodies, unusual
wear and sufficient tread depth.
Tread depth should if possible not be
allowed to drop below 3 mm (approx.
0.12 in), even though a minimum tread
depth of only 1.6 mm (approx. 0.06 in)
is required by law. Wear indicators
(arrow) in the base of the tread groove,
the distribution of which is indicated on
the tyre's shoulder with TWI (Tread
Wear Indicator) indicate when a tread
depth of 1.6 mm (approx. 0.06 in) has
been reached; this is the legal limit for
tyre wear. Below a tread depth of 3 mm
(approx. 0.12 in) there is a risk of aqua-
planing at fairly high road speeds even
if the water is not very deep.
390de331
Never continue driving with a flat
tyre. If air pressure is lost from a
tyre, this seriously affects the car's
handling and braking, and could cause
the driver to lose control. Avoid over-
loading the car, as this could cause
the tyres' load capacity limit to be
exceeded. Otherwise you could over-
heat the tyres and cause internal
damage to them in the short to medium
term. In some cases, this can result in
sudden loss of tyre pressure.
Unusual vibration while the car is being
driven could indicate a tyre fault or
some other defect on your car. This
may occur e.g. when driving over a kerb
or similar. The same applies to any
other abnormal road behaviour, such as
pulling severely to the right or left. In
such cases, reduce speed immediately.
Proceed carefully to the nearest BMW
Service or tyre dealer, or have the car
towed there so that it can be checked
or its tyres or wheels inspected.
All forms of tyre damage (which could in
the worst case lead to sudden and total
loss of pressure) represent a risk of
serious or even fatal injury to the car's
occupants and to all other road users.<

To maintain the car's good road behav-
iour, always fit tyres of the same make
and tread pattern to all wheels. BMW
tests and approves combinations of
wheels/tyres for use on your car.
Do not use retreaded tyres, as
these could have adverse effects
on the car's safety. Their carcasses
may differ in internal construction or
have aged sufficiently to cast doubt on
their durability.<
Age of tyres
A tyre's date of manufacture is shown
as part of the inscription on the tyre
wall:
DOT ... 2501 means for instance that
the tyre was manufactured in Week 25
of the year 2001.
BMW recommends tyre replacement
after not more than 6 years, even if
tyres up to 10 years old may still be
suitable.
Choosing the correct tyres
Fit only wheels and tyres that have
been approved by BMW for your
type of vehicle, otherwise the tyres may
e.g. make contact with the vehicle body
due to impermissible tolerances, even
though they are of an approved size;
this could result in a serious accident.
BMW is unable to assess the suitability
of wheels and tyres it has not approved
and cannot therefore guarantee their
safety.<
BMW has tested certain makes of tyre
for each tyre size, classified them as
safe for use and approved them. BMW
Service is able to provide the details of
these makes. Observe any national
legislation e.g. on entries required in
the vehicle documents
The correct wheel and tyre combi-
nation has an influence on various
systems, the function of which could
otherwise be adversely affected, for
instance ABS, AGS, ASC+T/DSC.
For this reason, fit only tyres of the
same make and tread pattern on all the
car's wheels, and after a puncture, for
instance, fit the approved wheel and
tyre combination again as soon as
possible.<
Tyre storage
Store wheels and tyres in a cool, dry
and preferably dark place when not in
use. Protect tyres against contamina-
tion from oil, grease and fuel.

The correct tyres
BMW recommends you to fit winter
tyres (M+S radial-ply) if the car is used
for driving in wintery conditions.
Although tyres sold for all-year use with
an M+S marking have better winter
characteristics than summer tyres
marked with speed letters H, V, W, Y or
ZR, they do not normally match the
performance of winter tyres.
In the interests of reliable directional
stability and steerability, fit winter tyres
of the same make and tread pattern to
all four road wheels.
Note the speed limit applicable to
these tyres
In Germany: a sticker stating the
maximum permitted speed must be
displayed in the driver's field of view if
the car is capable of speeds higher
than that permitted for the tyres. Suit-
able labels are available from tyre
suppliers or a BMW Service.
Never exceed the maximum speed
laid down for the winter tyres fitted
to your car.
Lack of expert knowledge or incorrect
handling of tyres can cause damage
and lead to accidents.
All work on tyres should therefore be
carried out only by experts. BMW
Service will gladly place its specialised
knowledge and facilities at your
disposal.<
Tyre condition and tyre pressures
Below a tread depth of 4 mm (0.16 in),
winter tyres become noticeably less
suitable for winter driving conditions
and should therefore be replaced for
safety reasons.
Keep to the specified tyre pressures
and have the wheels and tyres rebal-
anced each time the wheels are
changed or new tyres are fitted.
Fine-link BMW snow chains are only
permitted if fitted to both rear wheels.
When fitting, comply with the manufac-
turer's instructions. When snow chains
are in use, do not exceed 50 km/h
(approx. 30 mph).
If the car has 17 or 18-inch
wheels, snow chains cannot be
fitted.<

148n
To unlock
Pull the lever at the left under the
instrument panel.
Do not work on the car unless you
possess the appropriate special-
ised knowledge. If unfamiliar with the
regulations which have to be complied
with, have the work performed by BMW
Service; incorrect handling of parts and
materials could represent a safety risk
for the car's occupants or other road
users.<
390de759
To open
Pull the release lever and open the lid.
390de760
To close
Allow the engine compartment lid to
drop from a height of approx. 30 cm
(12 in) such that it is clearly heard to
engage.
To avoid injuries, as when closing
all doors or lids on the car, make
sure that the engine compartment lid is
unobstructed.
If you notice during the journey that the
engine compartment has not been
properly closed, stop the car at the
earliest possible moment and close it
correctly.<

Service.
Screenwash for the cleaning or
intensive cleaning systems is
easily ignited. Keep it away from
possible ignition sources and store it
only in the carefully sealed original
packs, out of reach of children. Comply
with the instructions on the pack.<
390de763
Checking engine oil level
1. Park the car on a horizontal surface
2. Switch off the engine, which should
be at its regular operating tempera-
ture
3. After about 5 minutes, take out the
dipstick and wipe it clean with a lint-
free cloth, paper tissue or similar
4. Carefully push the dipstick fully into
its tube, then pull it out again
5. The oil level must be between the
two marks on the dipstick.

The quantity of oil between the two
dipstick marks is approx. 1 litre
(1.8 pints). Do not add oil above the
upper dipstick mark. Adding too much
oil will harm the engine.
460de189
Adding engine oil
Do not add more oil until the level has
dropped almost as far as the lower
dipstick mark.
BMW engines are designed not
to need separate additives in the
engine oil, and indeed adding these
substances could even be harmful in
certain circumstances. This applies to
manual-shift gearbox or automatic
transmission, final drive and power
steering.<
Recommendation: have oil changes
carried out by BMW Service.
390de626
In laboratory tests, prolonged
contact with used oils has caused
cancer.
For this reason, always wash the
affected skin areas thoroughly with
soap and water after work.
Keep oils, greases, etc. out of chil-
dren's reach and in vessels marked
with a suitable warning.<
When disposing of used oil,
comply with the relevant environ-
mental protection laws.<

Specified engine oils
The quality of the engine oil is a deci-
sive factor for the correct operation and
long life of your car's engine. BMW has
conducted extensive tests before
approving certain grades of engine oil.
Petrol and diesel engines:
The highest quality standards are
achieved by oils which BMW has
approved as "long-life 01" oils.
Use only an approved grade of "long-
life 01" oil.
If you are unable to purchase one of
these oils, you can top up the oil level in
between oil changes, if only a small
amount of oil is needed, with a BMW-
approved "long-life 98" grade of oil.
Only if no such oil is available should
you top up the engine oil level with an
approved "special oil" or an oil to
ACEA: A3 specification.
BMW Service can provide details
of the oils approved by BMW for
your car's engine.<
Diesel engines:
The engine oil chosen must always
comply with the ACEA: A3/B3 or ACEA:
A3/B4 specification.
Approved "long-life 01" oils always
meet this specification.
Viscosities
All "long-life" oils approved by BMW
are suitable for operation at any
ambient temperature. You conse-
quently do not need to pay specific
attention to the viscosity class.
Do not top up the cooling system
while the engine is hot, otherwise
you may scald yourself on the resultant
coolant steam.
To avoid the risk of subsequent
damage, use only long-life antifreeze
and corrosion inhibitor free from nitrites
and amino compounds, and approved
by the manufacturer. BMW Service is
familiar with these products.
Antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor
constitutes a health hazard. Store it in
sealed original packs, out of reach of
children.
Long-life antifreeze and corrosion
inhibitor contains ethylene glycol, which
is flammable. For this reason, take care
not to spill long-life antifreeze and
corrosion inhibitor on hot parts of the
engine; it could ignite and cause
burns.<

Checking coolant level and
adding coolant
Diesel engine:
Correct coolant level with engine cold
(approx. 20 6):
Just below the KALT/COLD mark on
the translucent reservoir.
390de688
Spark-ignition engine:
Correct coolant level with engine cold
(approx. 20 6):
1. Turn the cap on the header tank
slightly anti-clockwise until it starts to
open, then allow the pressure to
escape before opening it fully
2. Coolant level is correct when the top
end of the red float rod is at least
level with the top of the filler pipe
(see arrow in picture), but not more
than 2 cm (0.8 in) higher, in other
words at the second mark on the
float rod (see also diagram next to
filler pipe).
380de081
3. If necessary, add more coolant.
Slowly top up to correct level Â– do
not overfill.
When disposing of used long-life
antifreeze and corrosion inhibitor,
comply with the relevant environmental
protection laws.<

Indicator light
If the warning light comes on
for brake hydraulics, or the
message "Check brake fluid"
appears in the Check Control: brake
fluid level is too low.
Adding brake fluid
The brake fluid reservoir is located
under the micro-filter housing on the
driver's side. To top up the brake fluid,
or to rectify the cause of any loss of
brake fluid, please consult BMW
Service which is familiar with the
factory-approved grades of brake fluid
(DOT 4).
Loss of brake fluid may cause brake
pedal travel to increase. Comply with
the instructions on page 144.
Brake fluid is hygroscopic, that is
to say it absorbs moisture gradu-
ally from the air.
To ensure that the car's brake system
remains in good working order, have
the brake fluid renewed every two years
by BMW Service, see also pages 80
and the Service Booklet. Brake fluid
constitutes a health hazard and also
attacks the car's paint. Store it in sealed
original packs, out of reach of children.
Do not spill brake fluid; add it only up to
the MAX mark on the reservoir. If it
comes into contact with hot parts of the
engine, brake fluid may ignite and
cause burns.<
When disposing of brake fluid,
always comply with the appro-
priate environmental legislation.<

The BMW Maintenance System is
designed to uphold the car's road
safety and operating reliability Â– and to

Service Interval indicator
Whereas conventional systems call for
maintenance when a fixed distance in
kilometres/miles has been covered, the
BMW Maintenance System has for
many years now taken the car's oper-
ating conditions into account as well,
since one kilometre is by no means the
same as another.
100,000 kilometres completed exclu-
sively in the form of short journeys
cannot be equated the same distance
made up of long main-road journeys
only.
The maintenance routines based on
actual use of the car consist of the Oil
Service and Inspections I and II.
The principle of determining mainte-
nance intervals according to load effec-
tively covers all the operating
conditions to which the car is likely to
be exposed. Drivers who cover only
very short annual distances Â– well
below 10,000 km (approx. 6,000 miles)
Â– should none the less have an engine
oil change carried out every two years,
since engine oil ages regardless of the
loads imposed on it.
Service Booklet
For further information on maintenance
points and the scope of maintenance
work, please refer to the car's Service
Booklet.
Depending on the circumstances in
which the car is used, it may be worth-
while to inspect it for damage caused
by stones flung up from the road, in
order to guard against subsequent
corrosion.
Have maintenance and repair
work carried out by BMW Service.
Make sure that maintenance work is
confirmed in the Service Booklet after it
has been carried out. These entries are
evidence that your car has been serv-
iced regularly and correctly, and are
also the basis of any warranty claims.<

Lights and bulbs make an important
contribution towards road safety.
Appropriate care and attention should
therefore be taken when handling these
components. If you are unfamiliar with
such tasks, it is better to entrust them
to BMW Service.
Do not touch the glass of a new
bulb with the fingers, because
even slight amounts of dirt or grease
will then be burned into the bulb and
reduce its working life. Use a clean
tissue, cloth or similar, or hold the bulb
by its base.<
A box containing spare bulbs is avail-
able from BMW Service.
Before any work is done on the
electrical system, switch off the
affected consumer equipment or
disconnect the negative terminal from
the battery, to prevent any risk of short-
circuits occurring.
Observe any instructions supplied by
the bulb manufacturer, to avoid causing
injury or damage when changing

Safety precautions in the event of
a puncture or tyre failure:
Halt the car as far away from the main
traffic flow as possible, on a firm
surface; switch on the hazard warning
flashers.
Engage the steering lock in the straight-
ahead position, apply the handbrake
and select first or reverse gear or
selector lever position P.
All occupants must leave the car and be
led to a point where they are not
exposed to risk, for example behind a
crash barrier at the side of the road.
If necessary, set up the warning triangle
or a flashing warning light at a sufficient
distance to the rear. Comply with rele-
vant local laws.
Only change wheels on a flat, firm and
non-slip surface. On a soft or low-grip
surface (snow, ice, tiles or similar) there
is a risk of the car or the jack sliding
sideways.
Position the car's jack on a firm surface.
Never place wood blocks or similar
under the jack, or the maximum lifting
capacity may be exceeded. When the
car has been jacked up, do not lie
under it or start the engine, as this
could lead to a potentially fatal acci-
dent.<
What you need
To avoid rattling noises later, please
make a note of the positions of the
tools when they are removed, and
replace them in the same positions
later.

For safety reasons, have the wheel stud
tightening torque checked without
delay, using a suitable calibrated torque
wrench (correct tightening torque =

If the car is not fitted with alloy wheels
of the Original BMW type, note that
different wheel studs may be needed.
Have a flat tyre repaired as soon as
possible, and the wheel and tyre rebal-

Fit dust caps on tyre valves, to keep dirt
out. Dirt in the tyre valve can often lead
to a gradual loss of air pressure.
For the lightweight wheel, use
only BMW-approved balance
weights for alloy wheels. Do not
attempt to use hammer-on steel
balance weights on these wheels.<
With certain tyre sizes, in the

this wheel can be used entirely satis-
factorily in all load and speed ranges, in
such cases, fit a wheel and tyre of the
correct size as soon as possible.<

careful note of this number and keep it
in a safe place, in case the adapter is
lost.
Maintenance
The battery needs no routine mainte-
nance whatsoever, in other words the
quantity of acid it contains will normally
last for the full operating life of the
battery in temperate climates.
Please address all queries
concerning the battery to BMW
Service. As the battery is absolutely
maintenance-free, the following infor-
mation is provided for reference only.<
Do not disconnect battery leads
while the engine is running, other-
wise excess current will destroy the
vehicle electronics unit.<
Recharging the battery
Recharge the battery only with the
engine stopped, via the connections in
the engine compartment (see "Starting
with a flat battery", page 173).
Dispose of old batteries only at an
authorised collecting point or
return them to BMW Service. Batteries
filled with acid should be transported
and stored upright. Protect batteries
against falling over when in transit.<

The Mobile Service of the BMW Group
is there to assist you round the clock,
including at weekends and on public
holidays.
If you have a breakdown, please call
the Mobile Service control centre for
your home country. The telephone
numbers are to be found in the "Service
Contact" brochure.
Do not use the spray products sold as
starting aids.
If the car's own battery is flat, your
BMW's engine can be started by using
two jump leads from another vehicle's
battery. In the same way, you can help
another car to start. Use only leads with
fully insulated battery post clips.
Do not touch any electrically live
parts when the engine is running,
or a fatal accident may occur. Do not
depart from the procedure described
below, otherwise personal injury could
result or one or both vehicles be
damaged.<
1. Check that the other vehicle's
battery has a voltage of 12 Volt.
This should be printed on the
battery cover
2. Do not disconnect the batteries
when jump-starting. Switch off any
consumers in both vehicles
3. The bodies of the two vehicles must
not make contact Â– risk of short-
circuit
4. Run the engine of the donor vehicle

5. With the jump lead marked (+),
establish a connection between the
positive terminal of the battery in
the other vehicle and the jump-
starting connection in the engine
compartment of the BMW. The cap
over this connection on the BMW is
marked "+" (see illustration). Fold
open the cap (arrow)
390de690
6. With the jump lead marked (Â–),
establish a connection between
the negative terminals of the two
vehicles. First connect it to the
negative battery terminal or to earth
(ground) on the engine or body of
the donor vehicle, then to the nega-
tive battery terminal or to earth
(ground) on the engine or body of
the vehicle which you wish to start.
On your BMW a special nut is
provided for this purpose on the
suspension strut housing; see
arrow in illustration
Always connect the jump leads in
the correct order, so that no
sparks which could cause injury occur
at the battery.<
390de146
7. Run the engine of the donor vehicle
at higher than idle speed for a few
minutes, then start the engine of the
other vehicle in the usual way. If an
initial attempt to start the engine
fails, wait several minutes until the
flat battery has been recharged to a
slightly greater degree
8. Allow both engines to run for a few
minutes before disconnecting the
jump leads
9. Disconnect the jump leads in the
opposite order from that in which
they were originally attached.
Have the battery recharged by BMW
Service if necessary.

Towing eye
The screw-in towing eye is kept in the
car's toolkit (on the touring, next to the
spare wheel) and should always be
carried on the car. It can be screwed in
at the front or the rear of the car, and is
only to be used for towing on a firm
road surface.
Access to threaded hole
Front:
Press the arrow symbol on the cover
and swing it out to remove.
390de087
Rear:
Press the arrow symbol on the cover
and swing it out to remove.
Screw the towing eye in fully to
avoid the risk of its thread being
damaged.
Never tow the car or lash it down at any
of the suspension elements, as this
could cause damage and lead to acci-
dents occurring later.<
For towing, use either a towbar or a
nylon rope or tapes; use of the latter
helps to avoid sudden tensile loads.
394de088
Avoid offset between the towing
and towed vehicle, and make sure
that the towrope is taut when the
towing vehicle moves off.<
Using a towbar
The towing eyes of both vehicles
should be on the same side. If it is
impossible to avoid attaching the
towbar at an angle, note the following:
> Towbar clearance may be restricted
when cornering
> The towbar will generate lateral
forces if it is attached offset.
Do not tow a vehicle heavier than
your own, as there is otherwise a
risk of losing control.<

Tow-starting
Cars with catalytic converter should
only be tow-started if the engine is
cold. It is always preferable to use jump
leads, see page 173.
1. Switch on the hazard warning
flashers (comply with local regula-
tions)
2. Turn the ignition key to position 2
3. Select 3rd gear
4. Keep the clutch pedal down. When
the car is moving, gradually release
the clutch pedal. After the engine has
fired and is running, depress the
clutch pedal again
5. Switch off the hazard warning
flashers.
Have the cause of starting problems
traced and rectified by BMW Service.
Automatic-transmission cars:
These cars cannot be tow-started.
Starting with jump leads: see page 173.
Towing away
1. Turn ignition key to position 1, to
enable the brake lights, turn indica-
tors, horn and windscreen wipers to
be activated
2. Switch on the hazard warning
flashers (comply with local regula-
tions)
If the car's electrical system has failed,
the car must be made identifiable to
following vehicles, for instance by
placing a notice or the warning triangle
in the rear window.
Make sure that the ignition key is
turned to position 1 even if the
electrical system has failed; this is to
ensure that the steering lock cannot
engage and prevent the car from being
steered.
When the engine is not running, there is
no power assistance and the brake
servo is out of action. The steering and
brakes will require extra effort to
operate.<
Automatic-transmission cars:
1. Set the selector lever to N
2. Maximum towing speed:
70 km/h (approx. 43 mph)
3. Maximum towing distance:
150 km (approx. 93 miles).

Fuel consumption is determined according to a standard test method (93/116/EU). It is not the same as the average fuel
consumption in practice, which depends on a great many different factors such as driving style, load, road condition, traffic
density and flow, weather, tyre pressures etc. Engine power output and road performance data are measured in the condi-
tions laid down by 80/1269 EU and DIN 70020 (with the car to standard specification). This standard specifies the permit-
ted tolerances. Additional equipment on the car may have quite a significant influence on both performance and fuel con-
sumption, since it usually affects the car's weight and c value (drag coefficient), for instance roof rack, wider tyres,
additional mirrors etc.
